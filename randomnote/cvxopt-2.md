#Outline of Convex Optimization Chapter2: Convex set

##1. Affine and convex sets
* line, line segments
* affine, affineset  
    *the relation of affine set and linear subspace(subspace + offset)
* dimension of an affine set  
    *notice the difference between dimension of linear space.
* every affine set can be expressed as the solution set of a system of linear equations.
* affine hull __aff *C*__ (smallest)
* relative interior __relint *C*__
* convex set, convex hull 




## ETC
* [definition of nullspace/kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nullspace)
* [Relative Interior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_interior)
