#Outline of Convex Optimization Chapter2: Convex set

##1. Affine and convex sets
* line, line segments
* affine, affineset  
    *the relation of affine set and linear subspace(subspace + offset)
* dimension of an affine set  
    *notice the difference between dimension of linear space.
* every affine set can be expressed as the solution set of a system of linear equations.
* affine hull __aff *C*__ (smallest)
* relative interior __relint *C*__
* convex set
* convex combination, convex hull  __Conv *C*__  
    *weight average  
    *generalize to infinite sum  
    *random, probablity, expectation  
* conea(non-negative homogeneous)  
    *convexcone  
    *conic combination(non-gegative linear combination)  
    *conic hull
* Some Examples(see book)
